# Problem 1

``` r
transit_df = read_csv("data/NYC_transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

## Dataset Description

The NYC Transit dataset contains 1868 observations of individual New
York City subway entrances and/or exits. The 19 variables selected for
include: the name of the transit line; the station name; the latitude
and longitude of that station; the routes the line services; whether or
not the station exits are also entrances; the type of entrance (stair,
elevator, etc.); if it is an accessible entrance; and if there is a
vending machine at that station. To clean the data, first we used the
`clean_names` function from the `janitor` package to make every variable
name lowercase and snake_case. Then, we selected for the variables of
interest, which are listed above. The resulting data set has the
dimensions described above: 1868 rows and 19 columns. This data set is
now tidy because all the columns are variables, all the rows are
observations, and every value has a cell.

## How Many Distinct Stations?

``` r
distinct_station_df = transit_df %>%
  group_by(station_name) %>%
  distinct(line)
```

There are 465 distinct stations.

## How Many Stations Are ADA Compliant?

``` r
ADA_compliant_df = transit_df %>%
  filter(ada == TRUE)

station_ada_df = ADA_compliant_df  %>%
  group_by(station_name) %>%
  distinct(line)
```

There are 84 ADA compliant distinct stations in this data set.

## What is the Proportion of Stations Without Vending Machines That Also Have Entrances?

``` r
no_vending_df = transit_df %>%
  filter(vending == "NO") 

entry_no_vending_df = no_vending_df %>%
  filter(entry == TRUE)

nrow(entry_no_vending_df)/nrow(no_vending_df)
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

About 37.7% of stations that do not have vending machines also have
entrances.

## Reformatting Data

``` r
line_route_df = transit_df %>% 
  distinct(line, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, .keep_all = TRUE)

A_train_df =  line_route_df %>%
  filter(route1 == "A" | route2 == "A" | route3 == "A" | route4 == "A" | route5 == "A" | route6 == "A" | route7 == "A" | route8 == "A" | route9 == "A" | route10 == "A" | route11 == "A")

ADA_A_df = A_train_df %>%
  filter(ada == TRUE)
```

There are 30 distinct stations that serve the A train, and of those
there are 14 that are ADA compliant.
